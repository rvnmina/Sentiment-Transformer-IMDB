    "# Text Classification Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Text Classification Challenge! In this task, you will develop a machine learning model to classify IMDb movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments. The challenge is designed to help you demonstrate your skills in natural language processing (NLP) and your ability to work with state-of-the-art transformer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to build a text classification model that accurately predicts whether a given movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis is a critical task in NLP with applications in marketing, customer feedback, social media monitoring, and more. Accurately classifying sentiments can provide valuable insights into customer opinions and help businesses make data-driven decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Task is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding customer sentiment through text data is crucial for businesses and organizations to respond effectively to customer needs and preferences. By automating the sentiment analysis process, companies can efficiently analyze vast amounts of data, identify trends, and make informed strategic decisions. For this challenge, we will use the IMDb dataset, a widely-used benchmark in sentiment analysis, to train and evaluate our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this challenge is the IMDb movie reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 reviews labeled as either positive or negative. This dataset is balanced, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews, making it ideal for training and evaluating sentiment analysis models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Columns:**\n",
    "  - `review`: The text of the movie review.\n",
    "  - `sentiment`: The sentiment label (`positive` or `negative`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The IMDb dataset provides a real-world scenario where understanding sentiment can offer insights into public opinion about movies, directors, and actors, as well as broader trends in the entertainment industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have revolutionized NLP by allowing models to consider the context of a word based on surrounding words, enabling better understanding and performance on various tasks, including sentiment analysis. Their ability to transfer learning from massive datasets and adapt to specific tasks makes them highly effective for text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to implement a transformer-based model for sentiment classification on the IMDb dataset. Follow the steps below to complete the challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure.\n",
    "   - Preprocess the data by cleaning text, encoding labels, and splitting into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Implementation:**\n",
    "   - Implement a transformer-based model for sentiment classification. You should consider writing Transformer blocks from scratch.\n",
    "   - Implement data loaders and training loops using a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training and Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Train your model and optimize hyperparameters for the best performance.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation:**\n",
    "   - Document your approach, experiments, and results.\n",
    "   - Discuss any challenges faced and propose potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prediction and Inference:**\n",
    "    - Implement a function that takes a movie review as input and predicts the sentiment (positive or negative).\n",
    "    - Test the function with custom reviews and display the predicted sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Deployment:**\n",
    "    - Save the trained model and any other necessary files.\n",
    "    - Prepare the model for deployment (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI).\n",
    "    - Prepare a basic front-end interface for the deployed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Submission:**\n",
    "    - Create a GitHub repository for your code.\n",
    "    - Write a detailed README.md file with instructions on how to train, evaluate, and use the model.\n",
    "    - Include a summary of your approach and the results in the README file.\n",
    "    - Your code should be well-documented and reproducible.\n",
    "    - Your repository should include a notebook showcasing the complete process, including data loading, preprocessing, model implementation, training, and evaluation.\n",
    "    - Apart from the notebook, you should also have all the codes in .py files so that it can be easily integrated with the API.\n",
    "    - You submission should also include a python script for the API.\n",
    "    - Your submission should also include a basic front-end for the deployed model.\n",
    "    - Submit the GitHub repository link.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, follow the structure provided in this notebook, complete each step, and explore additional techniques to enhance your model's performance. Make sure to document your findings and prepare a comprehensive report on your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck, and welcome to RealAI!\n"
